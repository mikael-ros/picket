## Want to work on such a feature or bug yourself?
You're very welcome to do so. All you need to know is basic GDScript and programming & git principles. Heres a short guide on how to get started:

1. Fork this repository
2. Install prerequisites
    - [git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
    - This plugin
3. Load the demo
4. Make sure the demo works as expected before making modifications
5. When done, submit a pull request and wait for review

### Some coding principles
- Avoid heavy algorithms
- Write clean and concise code, with descriptive variables
- Keep documentation comments up to date as you go (or before pull request)
- Write documentation in simple english

### Testing procedure
At the moment, not rigorous testing or test suite is applied, but make sure the demo works as expected at the very least.
